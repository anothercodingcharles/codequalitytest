# FOOD TRUCK FINDER

This application takes in the food truck data from the San Francisco governmentâ€™s API(https://data.sfgov.org/Economy-and-Community/Mobile-Food-Schedule/jjew-r69b) 
and displays the food trucks that are open at the time you run the application.

San Francisco API offers limit & offset fields to handle pagination. Thus, to prevent a high payload, the application displays NAME & ADDRESS of the open food trucks in chunks of 10. 
With this ,the search is restricted and performs better since has a smaller json payload coming back. 

# APPLICATION BUILDING BLOCKS

1.- A FoodTruckService that encapsulates the application's business logic.

2.- DTOs (FoodTruck,HTTPResponse) to simplify manipulation of HTTP response data by not having to use structure-specific APIs (i.e., for JSON, XML, etc.)

3.- Utility classes

  HTTPRequest class to execute the HTTP Request , control transactions and coordinating responses to HTTPResponse DTO
  A DateTimeProvider interface that provides a way to create LocalDateTime object, now() method  can be overridden to provide any localtime , thus making the    program testable.
  An AppProperties class to handle de reading of properties such as apptoke,baseurl,pagination pagesize defined in app.properties

4.- A App main program in charge of the command line printing logic.
