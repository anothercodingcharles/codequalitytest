# FOOD TRUCK FINDER

This application takes in the food truck data from the San Francisco governmentâ€™s API(https://data.sfgov.org/Economy-and-Community/Mobile-Food-Schedule/jjew-r69b) 
and displays the food trucks that are open at the time you run the application.

San Francisco API offers limit & offset fields to handle pagination. Thus, to prevent a high payload, the application displays NAME & ADDRESS of the open food trucks in chunks of 10. 
With this ,the search is restricted and performs better since has a smaller json payload coming back. 

# APPLICATION BUILDING BLOCKS

* FoodTruckService class that encapsulates the application's business logic.

* FoodTruck and HTTPResponse DTO (Data Transfer Object) classes to simplify manipulation of HTTP response data by not having to use structure-specific APIs (i.e., for JSON, XML, etc.)

* Utility classes/interfaces

    * HTTPRequest class to execute requests and coordinate responses to HTTPResponse DTO class.
    * DateTimeProvider interface that provides a way to create a LocalDateTime object using now() method. now() can be overridden to provide any localtime , thus   making the program testable.
    *  AppProperties class to handle de reading of properties such as apptoke, baseurl, pagesize defined in app.properties
    * An App main program in charge of the command line printing logic.
